# External Libraries

The Ownable contract from OpenZeppelin provides basic access control functionalities, allowing the contract to have an owner who can perform certain privileged actions, such as starting and ending the auction in this case.

# Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern

The Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern is a best practice for preventing reentrancy attacks by ensuring that the contract's state is updated before making any external calls.
The end() function follows the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern as follows:

The function performs all the necessary checks to ensure that the auction is started, not ended, and that the reserve price is met. These checks are performed before any changes are made to the contract's state or any external interactions occur.
The s_ended state variable is set to true after the checks are successfully completed. This update to the state variable is an effect of the function.
The external call to transfer the funds to the owner is made only after the s_highestBid value is reset to zero. This ensures that the contract's state is updated before any external interaction, preventing potential reentrancy attacks that exploit interactions with the contract's state after an external call.

By adhering to the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, the contract reduces the risk of reentrancy attacks that could manipulate the contract's state or exploit vulnerabilities through recursive calls.

# Withdrawal Pattern

The Withdrawal pattern allows users to manage their own funds within the contract, reducing the risk of funds getting stuck. by implementing the Withdrawal pattern, bidders can withdraw their funds at any time, even before the auction concludes.
The withdraw() function allows bidders to withdraw their pending returns. It first checks if a bidder has any funds pending for withdrawal, and then transfers the funds back to the bidder's Ethereum address. The withdrawn amount is deducted from both the bidder's specific pending returns and the total pending returns in the contract.

# Immutable

our Auction smart contract is designed to be immutable to enhance the security and therefore it cannot be upgraded or altered.
